# XOX Game (Tic-Tac-Toe)

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. The game supports two modes:
1. **Two Players**: Play against another player.
2. **One Player**: Play against the computer.

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd XOX_Game
   ```
3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python XOX_Game.py
   ```

## Game Rules

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Player 1 uses "X" and Player 2 (or the computer) uses "O".
- Players take turns to place their marks in an empty cell.
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.

## Features

- **Two-player mode**: Play with a friend.
- **Single-player mode**: Play against a computer opponent with random moves.
- **Replay option**: Restart the game after it ends.
